	<ul>
		<br>[Chorus: Soliven]<br>
<br>You stay on the west side where the sun stay high
and you stay high
I'm out on the next flight, I'll be back late night
I owe you some time<br> 

		<br>[Verse 1: Neeko]<br>
<br>Feel like you falling, falling, falling Let it slowly hit you, I feel it too
When the money hits you, you got the moves
Let the flames kiss you
Want to see you lost in it all
Then we gon' flex on 'em all
All the plaques go straight to the wall
All the ice don't matter
All the flights don't matter
All the nights I wonder
In my new whip
New drip, new money coming in
Everything but you
Got new rings, new links, new mink comin'
I'll put everything on you, on you<br>

	     <br>[Chorus: Soliven]<br>
<br>You stay on the west side where the sun stay high
and you stay high
I'm out on the next flight, I'll be back late night
I owe you some time<br> 
You stay on the west side where the sun stay high
And you stay high
I'm out on the next flight, I'll be back late night
I owe you some time<br>

		<br>[Verse 2: Neeko & Soliven]<br>
<br>In my new whip new drip, new money coming in everything
but you got new rings, new links, new mink comin'
i'll put everything on you, on you <br>
<br>High beams hot in the drop top you never been with the
small talk you never been with a real 1 you just want something
roll me one, let's get lost, ambiance feeeling your aura strong,
 when you on that strong we could be something look at that fire, 
 eyes with desire baby girl takin' me back to the blue reflections 
 of me on my chains and my rings none that shine brighter than you<br>

 		<br>[Chorus: Soliven]<br>
<br>You stay on the west side where the sun stay high
and you stay high
I'm out on the next flight, I'll be back late night
I owe you some time<br> 
You stay on the west side where the sun stay high
and you stay high
I'm out on the next flight, I'll be back late night
I owe you some time<br>

		<br>[Verse 3: Neeko]<br>
<br>Feel like we falling, falling, endlessy now you hold me down 
like you my G whether we high or we falling, falling, falling, 
when you pull up late night, so roll a few when the liquor hits, 
I taste it off your lips I'm thinking bout the next time <br>

		<br>[Chorus: Soliven]<br>
<br>You stay on the west side where the sun stay high
and you stay high
I'm out on the next flight, I'll be back late night
I owe you some time<br> 
You stay on the west side where the sun stay high
and you stay high
I'm out on the next flight, I'll be back late night
I owe you some time<br>
